## [Learn a New Programming Language: Scheme]

In this semester, I start to learn about Scheme. This is a new programming language for me because I never use it before. 

Compared with Java, it is more simple and easy to understand. I followed the materials that provided by my professor, then read the instruction and try to realize the meanings of those syntax and expression.

The website at [https://web-artanis.com/scheme.html] is really useful for me to learn, it includes many details of Scheme. For example, how to add a while loop.


    (define-syntax-rule (while condition body ...)

      (let loop ()
    
        (when condition
    
          body ...
      
          (loop))))

    (let ((i 0))

      (while (< i  10)
  
        (display i)
    
        (set! i (1+ i))))
    

Also, there are lots of Scheme tutorial video in YouTube, I searched the relevant topic and got much help from it. The video in this playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2AAF068E55B8E61F] is very useful, the tutor describes the knowledges of Scheme clearly and he shows the process step by step.

And I took some practice questions from the internet and try to do them. Although now I still in the beginning, I don't do well on all the questions. However, I think if I do more practice in the future, I can appreciate problems better, understand their dynamics and offer the appropriate solutions.
