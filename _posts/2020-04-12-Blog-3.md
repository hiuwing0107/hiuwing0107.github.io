## 2020/04/12 [Differences between Java and Scheme]

I would like to talk about the differences between Java and Scheme in this post. 

Java programming language is the most popular programming language for developing client-server web applications for the internet. It is a very powerful real world language based on the object-oriented programming concepts. We can define it as a simple, Object-oriented and statically-typed programming language. Everything in Java is an object. The language features are easily tensile as there is a solid object-based model for programming. It supports all the major features of Object-oriented programming. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented programming. It is commonly used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games and numerical computing.

Scheme is a functional/procedural based programming language. It is an alternate of LISP language which has lexical scoping, uniform evaluation rules and uniform treatment of data types. And it is a general-purpose computer programming language that supports operations on structured data. For example, vectors,strings and lists, as well as operations on more traditional data such as numbers and characters. Its syntax is extremely regular and easy to pick up. Everything in Scheme is built up from a very small set of primitives which compose in a natural and intuitive fashion. It is typically used to write text editing programs, analyzing and optimizing application based compilers, writing drivers for graphics cards and developing operating systems.

Compare Scheme with Java, Scheme has many convenient and flexible features, making it capable of many tasks, which cannot be done by Java. Also, Scheme actually accords both functional programming and imperative programming roughly equal status. In contrast, Java is staunchly imperative. Moreover, Scheme syntax is formal and extremely easy to write. Users can express it in a paragraph. By comparison, Java needs proper syntax to follow. Finally, Java is more orthogonal as compared to Scheme. For example, the way to print out the message "Hello World".

**In Scheme:**

(begin

  (display "Hello, World!")
  
  (newline))
  
  
**In Java:**

public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
    
   System.out.println("Hello, World");
      
  }
    
}
