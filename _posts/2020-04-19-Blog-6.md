Apart from the programming, I am interested on video editing too. Therefore, in recent days, I try to learn about the film edit skills. The above video is the first tutorial video that I watched, it is clearly and detailed, and shows the instruction step by step. 

Beacause of the COVID-19, Adobe is providing temporary at-home access to Creative Cloud for student, thus I can download Adobe Premiere Pro 2020, a video editing software package from the platform. 

This software is very thoughtful that it provides a function in the beginning to show an easy-to-follow progression, the directive message lead me to move forward and learn the edit process. For example, how to import the video, describe the timeline basics, add the effects, export, and more.
