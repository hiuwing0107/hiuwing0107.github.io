I have learnt about an Application Programming Interface (API). It is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another, two machines can connect to each others, and then have one machine get data from another. Through the tutorial video from Professor.Katherine Chuang, I knew how to connect the API endpoint using DEMO_KEY in an API request builder. 

[Tutorial Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xu1CE8m7Do&feature=youtu.be]

Follow the instruction from the tutorial video, I did the exercise as follows. I connected to an API end point of NASA Picture of the Day and display the information from the API in a nicely formatted way.

I used Postwoman to ensure my endpoints are working with other services as expected, and my API works according to its specifications. It generates and host browser based API documentation in real time.

- Step 1:

  ### Access data from an API end point in https://postwoman.io/ to preview the response from a HTTP GET request

      GET: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY

   { "copyright": "Antonio\nFinazzi", "date": "2020-04-11", "explanation": "Shared around world in early April skies Venus, our brilliant evening star, wandered across the face of the lovely Pleiades star cluster. This timelapse image follows the path of the inner planet during the beautiful conjunction showing its daily approach to the stars of the Seven Sisters. From a composite of tracked exposures made with a telephoto lens, the field of view is also appropriate for binocular equipped skygazers. While the star cluster and planet were easily seen with the naked-eye, the spiky appearance of our sister planet in the picture is the result of a diffraction pattern produced by the camera's lens. All images were taken from a home garden in Chiuduno, Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy, fortunate in good weather and clear spring nights.

  ### Parse the data, which requires understanding their data structures
  

      1. add a new key in Parameters (date 2020-04-04)

         - Parameters list
  
           ?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date=2020-04-04
  
           date : 2020-04-04

"explanation": "After wandering about as far from the Sun on the sky as Venus can get, the brilliant evening star is crossing paths with the sister stars of the Pleiades cluster. Look west after sunset and you can share the ongoing conjunction with skygazers around the world. Taken on April 2, this celestial group photo captures the view from Portal, Arizona, USA. Even bright naked-eye Pleiades stars prove to be much fainter than Venus though. Apparent in deeper telescopic images, the cluster's dusty surroundings and familiar bluish reflection nebulae aren't quite visible, while brighter Venus itself is almost overwhelming in the single exposure. And while Venus and the Sisters do look a little star-crossed, their spiky appearance is the diffraction pattern caused by multiple leaves in the aperture of the telephoto lens. The last similar conjunction of Venus and Pleiades occurred nearly 8 years ago.",
