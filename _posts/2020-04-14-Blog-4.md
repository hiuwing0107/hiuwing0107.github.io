## [Book Review: Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases]

I read a book named "Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases" by Joshua Bloch,  Neal Gafter. This book was about Java programming language, the content is filled with brainteasers about Java and its core libraries. It shows many puzzles that exploit counterintuitive or obscure behaviors that can lead to bugs. By working through the puzzles, I can learn how to avoid these underlying traps. Then, in future, I can be carefully and prevert to fall prey to these dangers in my code. 

I love this book so much. I would recommend it to the people who are programmed in Java, I believe they will love it too. It is a real eye-opener to the kind of traps in the code that I wouldn't even imagine could be there. It provides a lot of good puzzles designed to make me think about how Java works. Also, I learnt lots of knowledge about Java, JVM and the intricacies of OOP in the book. 

For the above reasons, it is very useful book for improving my Java programming skills.
