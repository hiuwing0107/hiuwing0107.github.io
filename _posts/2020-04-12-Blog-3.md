I would like to talk about the differences between Java and Scheme in this post. 

Java programming language is the most popular programming language for developing client-server web applications for the internet. It is a very powerful real world language. We can define it as a simple, Object-oriented and statically-typed programming language. Everything in Java is an object. The language features are easily tensile as there is a solid object-based model for programming. It supports all the major features of Object-oriented programming. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented programming.

Scheme is an alternate of LISP language which has lexical scoping, uniform evaluation rules and uniform treatment of data types. It is a general-purpose computer programming language that supporting operations on structured data. For example, vectors,strings and lists, as well as operations on more traditional data such as numbers and characters. Its syntax is extremely regular and easy to pick up. Everything in Scheme is built up from a very small set of primitives which compose in a natural and intuitive fashion.
