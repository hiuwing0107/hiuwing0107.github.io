## 2020/05/06 Version Control System (VCS)

Today, I would like to talk about Version Control System (VCS). I always use it when I work on my group project. It is a very useful system and help me to do my work smoothly.

VCS is a good tool that it helps group simultaneously work on a single project. We can compare our files and identify the differences through the project. Also, this system allows us to store the history of changes, then we can know who made the changes through the records. The most effective function is that we can use shared folder to share the file with other group members. As a result, people in our group can see and edit the files directly.

When I use VCS, if I want to make a change or want to save a new version of my project, I will write a commit message with the short description of my changes in order to help my group member understand my alteration and idea. Also, I must test my commit first before I commit in order to avoid to make any errors or side effects.

It is a really helpful assistance system to make our work more efficient. Due to the benefit and convenience, thereâ€™s no reason to not use one.
