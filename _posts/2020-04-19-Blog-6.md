## [Learn a New Software: Adobe Premiere Pro 2020]

Tutorial Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGobj8RGMs4]

Apart from the programming, I am interested in video editing too. In recent days, I have tried to learn about film edit skills. The above video is the first tutorial video that I watched, it is clear and detailed, and shows the instruction step by step. It shows how to execute most of the fundamentals, including import video files, creating sequences, adding clips to your timeline, setting in and out points, rearranging, moving, stretching clips, as well as the razor tool.

Because of the COVID-19, Adobe is providing temporary at-home access to the Creative Cloud for the student, thus I can download free Adobe Premiere Pro 2020, a video editing software package from the platform. 

This software is very thoughtful since it provides a function in the beginning to show an easy-to-follow progression, the directive message leads me to move forward and learn the edit process. For example, how to import the video, describe the timeline basics, add the effects, export, and more.

In order to be more proficient, I did the steps based on the tutorial message and video. The below image is the work process that I did. It is really interesting.
