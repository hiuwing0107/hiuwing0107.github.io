## [Book Review: Introduction to Algorithms]

I would like to share a book named "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen,  Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein. This book is very useful for every programmer. I read this book because I have taken CISC 3220-Analysis of Algorithms in this semester, it is used in the course. And I found it is very detailed and the content in the book gives a mathematical and in depth look which can help me understand the algorithms and data structures. There are exercises after each chapter. Those practice questions are very important to fully understand the chapter that I read. Also, it can activate my brain's neurons.

This book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, it contains the essential and the most popular algorithms. It comes with nice pseudocode, detailed walk-throughs and complexity analysis that along with the worst case, average case and amortized complexity.

For example, 

    INSERTION-SORT(A)

      for j = 2 to A.length
  
         key = A[j]􏰀
     
         // Insert A[j]􏰀 􏰀 into the sorted sequence A[1..j - 1􏰀].
         
          i = j􏰐 - 1
          
          while i > 0 and A[i] 􏰀> key
          
             A[i + 1]􏰀 = A[i]􏰀
             
             i = i - 􏰐1
             
          A[i + 1]􏰀 = key
          
          
      - Best Case : Θ(n)    
      
      - Worst Case : Θ(n^2)
      
      - Average Case : Θ(n^2)
      

The book in itself is an outstanding one, very organized, focused and small chapters make it easier to understand the algorithms inside it. I was already pretty familiar with almost all of the algorithms and data structures discussed.
