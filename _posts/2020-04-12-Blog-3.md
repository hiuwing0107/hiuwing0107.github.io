I would like to talk about the differences between Java and Scheme in this post. 

Java programming language is the most popular programming language for developing client-server web applications for the internet. It is a very powerful real world language based on the object-oriented programming concepts. We can define it as a simple, Object-oriented and statically-typed programming language. Everything in Java is an object. The language features are easily tensile as there is a solid object-based model for programming. It supports all the major features of Object-oriented programming. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented programming.

Scheme is a functional/procedural based programming language. It is an alternate of LISP language which has lexical scoping, uniform evaluation rules and uniform treatment of data types. And it is a general-purpose computer programming language that supporting operations on structured data. For example, vectors,strings and lists, as well as operations on more traditional data such as numbers and characters. Its syntax is extremely regular and easy to pick up. Everything in Scheme is built up from a very small set of primitives which compose in a natural and intuitive fashion.

Compare Scheme with Java, Scheme has many convenient and flexible features, making it capable of many tasks, which cannot be done by Java. Also, 

Scheme is the easy language to learn first for beginners in computer science.where as java needs minimum programming knowledge of C language to understand it.
Scheme syntax is formal and extremely easy to write.It can be expressed in a paragraph. where as java needs proper syntax to follow. beginner might put more effect to learn it.
java is a powerful and most popular language. where as scheme also have the powerful syntax when it used properly.
scheme can be used as standalone programming language and also scripting language.java is the powerful programming language for standalone application also for network applications.
coming to readability scheme code contains lots of parenthesis which may confuse first.but the expressions are formal.so its easy to understand. as java has special syntax so it is only understandable to the people who learned java.
the same concept came with writing ability of the code.scheme is derived from LISP characteristics. parenthesis used to separate the code blocks easily and it become easier to write by practice.
Scheme is the best language to learn first. it is ideal to introduce the beginners in programming language. and if we want build a new programming language.its more useful to write the semantics.
where as java is a powerful language to build real world programs like network applications.

? When would one use each of the languages?
