Because of this assignment, I learned how to create a blog with Jekyll And GitHub Pages. This is a very useful tool in daily life.

In order to make the procedure more simple, I use Jekyll Now to create the Jekyll blog. It eliminating a lot of the up front setup. During the process, I don't need to touch the command line to install anything. Just need a few minutes, a minimal and responsive blog will be set up.

Step 1: Search Jekyll Now in Google and then choose the first result: barryclark/jekyll-now
Step 2: Click "Fork" in the top right corner, then copy and paste that repo into my own github account as my own repo. After that, I will see hiuwing0107/jekyll-now in my account
Step 3: Click "Setting" and rename the Repository name to hiuwing0107.github.io
Step 4:Go through the (README.md) to read the instruction


Jekyll is built in the Ruby language by Github. I can use Github Pages for free to host my static website and easily link it with my custom domain name using a CNAME file in the repo.

There are different folders, and I can edit them to custom my blog. For example, I can change my Blog's title, description and footer-links in (_config.yml) file. Also, I can adjust my Blog's background color, font-size and text_align in (style.scss) file. And in (_posts) file, it includes all my blog posts, I can edit and review my article right there.
