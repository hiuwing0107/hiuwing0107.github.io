Because of this assignment, I learned how to create a blog with Jekyll And GitHub Pages. This is a very useful tool in daily life.

In order to make the procedure more simply, I use Jekyll Now to create the Jekyll blog. It eliminats a lot of the upfront setup. During the process, I don't need to touch the command line to install anything. Just need a few minutes, a minimal and responsive blog will be set up.

Step 1: Search Jekyll Now in Google and then choose the first result: "barryclark/jekyll-now"
Step 2: Click "Fork" in the top right corner, then copy and paste that repository into my own github account as my own repository. After that, I will see "hiuwing0107/jekyll-now "in my account
Step 3: Click "Setting" and rename the Repository name to "hiuwing0107.github.io"
Step 4:Go through the (README.md) file to read the instruction and click the link "Prose by Development Sheed"
Step 5: Click View Project "hiuwing0107.github.io" and it will show the regular layout there



Jekyll builts on the Ruby language by Github. I can use Github Pages for free to host my static website and easily link it with my custom domain name using a CNAME file in the repository.

There are different folders in that layout, I can edit them to custom my blog. For example, I can change my Blog's title, description and footer-links in (_config.yml) file. Also, I can adjust my Blog's background color, font-size and text_align in (style.scss) file. And in (_posts) file, it includes all my blog posts, I can edit and review my article right there.
