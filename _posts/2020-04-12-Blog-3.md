I would like to talk about the differences between Java and Scheme in this post. 

Java programming language is the most popular programming language for developing client-server web applications for the internet. It is a very powerful real world language. We can define it as a simple, Object-oriented and statically-typed programming language. Everything in Java is an object. The language features are easily tensile as there is a solid object-based model for programming. It supports all the major features of Object-oriented programming.

Scheme has lexical scoping, uniform evaluation rules and uniform 
treatment of data types. It is a general-purpose computer programming language that supporting operations on structured data. For example, vectors,strings and lists, as well as operations on more traditional data such as numbers and characters.



? When would one use each of the languages?
